# API Instructions

## Purpose

Maintain strict API contracts and consistent server/client mock behavior.

## Do

- Keep request/response shapes schema-driven and type-safe.
- Reuse endpoint constants and shared response helpers.
- Keep handler response envelope consistent (`code`, `data`, `message`).
- MSW success payloads: use `successWithSchema` / `paginatedWithSchema` / `successWithNullBody` from `src/mocks/createHandler.ts` so responses match Zod contracts before `HttpResponse.json`.
- Ensure mock handlers reflect real API behavior and error semantics.
- Keep naming stable for endpoint keys and mutation/query keys.

## Do Not

- Do not return ad-hoc response shapes for one-off convenience.
- Do not bypass schema parsing in new client mutations/queries.
- Do not mix unrelated domain endpoints in the same module.

## Validation

- Verify TypeScript and schema parsing paths compile cleanly.
- Run: `pnpm exec vp check --no-fmt`
- After changing `createHandler` or handler envelopes: `pnpm run test:unit` (includes `src/mocks/createHandler.test.ts`).
